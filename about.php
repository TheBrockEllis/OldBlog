    <h1>Greetings and salutations!</h1>
    <p>My name is Brock Ellis. I am a open web evangelist and web developer from Fremont, Ne.</p>
    
    <p>My full time job is at <em>Sycamore Leaf Solutions </em>where I am a full stack developer. I absolutely love my job. You know that saying "Do something that you love and never work a day in your life"? Yea, I live it. I've worked there for 3 years now and still don't feel like I've worked at all. My responsibilities there are to manage the new feature design and implementation processes, work with customers to figure out those new feautures, and sometimes (when I'm lucky...) get down to brass tacks and code.</p>
    
    <p>I recently started my own web design firm, <em>Sharproot Media</em> with my best friend Nick Scheck (@schrecknk). We didn't go into business to make money, but more to give legitamcy to our desire to help small businesses harness the web to help them succeed. Since we use Wordpress as our main tool for establishing a web presence for our customers, it isn't all that technically challenging. What is challenging, and more fufilling, is interacting with humans and having a dialog about what their needs and desires and finding a solution.</p>
    
    <p>I love to learn new things. After gaining a firm grasp on the LAMP stack and jQuery, I debated between learning node.js and Ruby on Rails. I am starting down the RoR path but am undecided whether that will be my next technological adventure or not.</p>
    
    <p>When not dabbeling in new technologies or reading Hacker News, I am probably playing with my family. I have an amazing wife, 2 doofus dogs and one wonderful daughter. I live a century old home which is in a constant state of improvement. </p>
